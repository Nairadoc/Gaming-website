# Gaming-website
A gaming website with 3 working games (Wordle, memory game, Tic Tac Toe) and a cool neon design. 

This website has three games:

### 1. Wordle:

Player gets 6 chances to guess a 5 letter word. After each guess, the player gets feedback after each guess for correct letters in correct spots (will turn green), correct letters in wrong spot (turn yellow color), letters not in the word at all (become grey).

### 2. Memory Game:
 
There are pairs of cards with same images. At first all cards are flipped backwards and the player starts by flipping two cards forward, when the player selects both pairs of images they stay flipped forward, if not (both images are different) they flip backwards again. The game is won when all cards become forward facing.
The aim is is to win the game in as little time as as little moves are possible.

### 3. Tic Tac Toe:

This is a classic 2 player game usually played on paper with pens. The goal of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player to get three in a row on a 3-by-3 grid.
